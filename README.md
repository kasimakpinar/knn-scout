## 1. Introduction

Recently, Real Madrid sold Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus. Who should they sign for a replacement?

Well, data science shows that the best option is to buy **Harry Kane** from Tottenham. Also, Ciro Immobile could be usefull addition to the squad since data science shows that he has similar playing style. Surprisingly, it seems that non-famous 18 years old Newells Old Boys player Enzo Cabrera also has similar playing style with Cristiano Ronaldo. Good prospect for the future, maybe?

In this project, we will use machine learning to try to find football players who has similar playing style with a given base player.
